# C-Labs
# This a collection of labs I have completed over the course of my second semester of freshman year. I took
# computer science I and we learned C++. We did various labs ranging from identifying errors in code,
# calculating blood pressure, creating a hangman game, stores sales, etc. 

# We worked with data types, abstract data types, classes, structs, enums, scopes, etc.
